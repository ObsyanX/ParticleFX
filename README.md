# ✨ ParticleFX  
### Turn Static Images into Cinematic 3D Particle Videos

🚀 **Live App:** https://particlefx.lovable.app  

ParticleFX is a modern web platform that transforms static images into **real-time 3D particle animations** and **cinematic video transitions** — directly in the browser, with no 3D experience required.

---

## 🌌 What is ParticleFX?

**ParticleFX** is a creative SaaS platform for **creators, developers, marketers, and designers** who want to bring images to life using **WebGL-powered particle systems** and **smooth 3D transitions**.

It combines:
- Real-time WebGL rendering  
- Particle-based morphing effects  
- Image-to-video animation workflows  
- A scalable, startup-ready architecture  

All wrapped in a **modern, glassmorphic UI**.

- Pixel-to-particle conversion  
- Depth-based 3D movement and camera motion  

### ✨ Advanced Particle Effects
- Explode  
- Morph  
- Swirl  
- Wave  
- Depth Push (Z-axis motion)  

### 🎞️ Timeline-Based Sequencing
- Visual sequence editor  
- Adjustable transition durations  
- Smooth easing functions  

### 👤 User Accounts & Projects
- Secure authentication  
- Saved projects and assets  
- Dashboard-based workflow  

### 💸 Monetization-Ready
- Subscription plans (Free / Pro / Studio)  
- Usage tracking  
- Watermarking for free tier  

### 📦 Video Export (MVP)
- Browser-based video export  
- WebM output using MediaRecorder  
- Production-grade backend rendering planned

## 🧠 How It Works

```
Upload Images
     ↓
Convert Pixels → Particles
     ↓
Animate Transitions in 3D
     ↓
Preview Live in Browser
     ↓
Export Video / Save Project
```

What you preview is rendered **live using WebGL**, not pre-recorded demos.

## 🎨 Visual & UX Design

ParticleFX follows a **modern creative-tool aesthetic**:

- Glassmorphism UI (blur + translucency)  
- Dark mode by default (light mode toggle)  
- Smooth page transitions  
- Micro-interactions and hover effects  
- Accessible navigation and keyboard support  

### 3D Visuals
- Spline-powered 3D hero animations  
- Floating particle fields  
- Subtle camera motion and depth cues  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React  
- Three.js  
- GSAP  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Spline (3D embeds)  

### Backend / Platform
- Lovable Cloud  
- Supabase Auth  
- PostgreSQL  
- Supabase Storage  

### Rendering (Current & Future)
- Browser-based WebGL preview  
- MediaRecorder (MVP export)  
- Planned: Headless Three.js + FFmpeg + GPU workers  

---

## 🧱 Architecture Philosophy

ParticleFX is built with a **hybrid rendering architecture**:

- Fast browser previews today  
- Config-driven animation system  
- Plug-and-play backend rendering later  
- Clean separation of UI, animation logic, and rendering engine  

This enables:
- Rapid iteration  
- Scalability  
- Production readiness  

---

## 📈 Roadmap

### ✅ MVP (Current)
- Live 3D preview
